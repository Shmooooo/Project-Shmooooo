Plots the Mandlebrot set!

Don't torture this thing with weird values.

Zoom in on any part of the mandlebrot set by setting real and imaginary bounds,
specify arbitrary recursion depth for a more accurate picture
(though some of the low-recursion plots look interesting as well as funny).

Uses the ghettorific PGM format because it's so easy. Deal with it.

Oh, you can also specify picture resolution, but if you go overboard with resolution and/or precision
your CPU will catch fire.
